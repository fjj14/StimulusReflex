What is a way that you could use Stimulus Reflex in your product?
We can use it to automatically update products and reviews when they are posted by users
What problem does Stimulus Reflex solve, and how does it relate if at all to WebSockets?
It solves the problem of automatic update on different tabs so different users don't have to refresh. Stimulus sends the updated version to the different websockets so the users don't have to refresh

Please comment on points of confusion or enlightenment with Stimulus Reflex.
I was confused when it came to running it on a different server
